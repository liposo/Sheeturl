# Sheeturl
The idea is to be able to quickly save links without having to log in into some system. 
It's is not meant to be a bookmark manager. 

The story behind: I don't like to use my personal accounts at work and there are so many links I come across that I want to save and look it later.  

[Google Script](https://gist.github.com/liposo/19978792ffa0576e0266d9cb1603ca25) used to write and read values in the Google Sheet.

How to use this (at its current state):

1. [Sheeturl - Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sheeturl/mefhmohbajnhdfjnfjmemdnhoabfgcmb)
2. Create a Google sheet and share it, make the permissions like in the image

7. Click on the extension icon to save the URL and Title of the current tab; saved URLs can be seen in the options page.
